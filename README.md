# verkauf-konig
## Description
This App is meant to provide a seamless way to place an order at a restaurant or service; kind of like Panera, but everywhere!
## Notes
In German, Verkaufen means 'to sell,' and KÃ¶nig means 'King.' So, 'SellKing,' or something akin (working title).
This App is meant to replace waiters and waitresses, or at least the busywork of taking orders!
